#higher priority
- fix gamemode cold start from < 2 players
- fix chat (make it so that people that are dead cannot speak to live people? lets see how people like this chat right now)

#medium priority
- anticheat (maybe use QAC for now until i get around to making my own. QAC can be bypassed)

#lower priority
- specdm (complete rewrite)
- pointshop. people want to show off their skills by putting things on their player. ill add that when people start asking for it
