# todo

get jb to usable state
- redo the autoswap from < 2 players. it dont work no i cannot fix anyhit

gm additions
- freekill manager -> lets see if i can implement tommy's into jb
- specdm -> prob need to rewrite it

ulx
- timed mute/gags

notes
- remember to fix PlayerSay so that it doesnt break chat commands from other addons -> make it so that only ded people can type to ded chat

Would be an interesting project to make my own anticheat.
