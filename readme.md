# todo

get jb to usable state
- work on scoreboard and weapon spawn menu
- rework the notify system
- redo the swapping system (dont swap prisoners to guards because that leads to more people not knowing guard rules)

gm additions
- guns showing on playermodels
- freekill manager
- specdm

ulx
- add ulx respawn, ulx move, ulx guardban (working with db, sqlite for now since internet problems)
- Kill() to slay type commands
- timed mute/gags

notes
- remember to swap AdminNotify back to being staff only, swapped out for testing reasons
- remember to fix PlayerSay so that it doesnt break chat commands from other addons
